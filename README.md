# cb3_cheat_table
A CheatEngine cheat table for Crash Bandicoot 3 (BETAs and Final release)

# It will work only with the PAL version of the game (SCES-01420). The offsets rely on RetroArch using BeetlePSX HW.
The beginning offset of the game is written in the META "folder" of the cheat table.

# There are 3 structures for dissecting the offsets, the one called "OBJECT" shows the object's variables, the one called "LEVEL" shows the level's variables, the one called "CAMERA" shows the camera variables.

It's a messy cheat table since I wasn't planning to upload it on the internet.
Some offsets have keybindings, for example to navigate the camera.
Some offsets just don't work anymore, because I'm not able to find static offsets with RetroArch.
