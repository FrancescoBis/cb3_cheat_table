# cb3_cheat_table
A CheatEngine cheat table for Crash Bandicoot 3 (Prototype, BETAs and Final release versions)

# The offsets rely on RetroArch using Beetle PSX HW (commit a48aa45)
The beginning offset of the game is written in the META "folder" of the cheat table.

# 3 of the structures for dissecting the offsets are: "OBJECT" contains an object's variables; "LEVEL" contains some global and current level variables; "CAMERA" contains the camera variables.

It's a messy cheat table since I wasn't planning to upload it on the internet.
Some offsets have keybindings, for example to navigate the camera.
Some offsets just don't work anymore, because I'm not able to find static offsets with RetroArch.
