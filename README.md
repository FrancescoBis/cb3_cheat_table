# cb3_cheat_table
A CheatEngine cheat table for Crash Bandicoot 3 (BETAs and Final release)

# It will work only with the PAL version of the game (SCES-01420). The offsets rely on RetroArch using BeetlePSX HW, the beginning offset of the game is written in the META "folder" of the cheat table.
It's a messy cheat table since I wasn't planning to upload it on the internet.
Some offsets have keybindings, for example to navigate the camera.
